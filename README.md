# Mark Wagner's Resume

I made my own resume XML DTD (document type definition) and XSLTs (extensible
stylesheet language transformations) to convert the XSL (with `xsltproc` ) into PDF (via TeX and with `pdftex` ), HTML, 
and plain text.

The latest artifact release is on [GitHub](https://github.com/mark-wagner/resume/releases/latest).

The artifacts *might* also be available on my [website](https://www.lanfear.net/mark/resume/).
